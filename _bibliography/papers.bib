ABSTRACT="The increasing complexity of 6G systems demands innovative tools for
network management, simulation, and optimization. This work introduces the
integration of ns-3 with Sionna RT, establishing the foundation for the
first open source full-stack Digital Network Twin (DNT) capable of
supporting multi-RAT. By incorporating a deterministic ray tracer for
precise and site-specific channel modeling, this framework addresses
limitations of traditional stochastic models and enables realistic,
dynamic, and multilayered wireless network simulations. Tested in a
challenging vehicular urban scenario, the proposed solution demonstrates
significant improvements in accurately modeling wireless channels and their
cascading effects on higher network layers. With up to 65\% observed
differences in application-layer performance compared to stochastic models,
this work highlights the transformative potential of ray-traced simulations
for 6G research, training, and network management."

ABSTRACT="The growing demand for high-speed, reliable wireless connectivity in 6G
networks necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the limitations of
traditional Radio Access Network (RAN). Reconfigurable Reconfigurable
Intelligent
Surface (RIS) and Network-Controlled Repeater (NCR) have
emerged as promising technologies to address coverage challenges
in high-frequency millimeter wave (mmW) bands by enhancing
signal reach in environments susceptible to blockage and severe
propagation losses. In this paper, we propose an optimized
deployment framework aimed at minimizing infrastructure costs
while ensuring full area coverage using only RIS and NCR.
We formulate a cost-minimization optimization problem that
integrates the deployment and configuration of these devices to
achieve seamless coverage, particularly in dense urban scenarios.
Simulation results confirm that this framework significantly
reduces the network planning costs while guaranteeing full
coverage, demonstrating RIS and NCR's viability as cost-effective
solutions for next-generation network infrastructure."

ABSTRACT="The advances in the automotive industry with the ever-increasing request
for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are pushing for a new epoch of
networked wireless systems. Vehicular communications, or
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), are expected to be among the main actors of
the future beyond 5G and 6G networks. However, the challenging application
requirements, the fast variability of the vehicular environment, and the
harsh propagation conditions of high frequencies call for sophisticated
control mechanisms to ensure the success of such a disruptive technology.
While traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) lack the flexibility to
support the required control primitives, the emergent concept of Open RAN
(O-RAN) appears as an ideal enabler of V2X communication orchestration.
However, how to effectively integrate the two ecosystems is still an open
issue. In this paper, we discuss possible integration strategies,
highlighting the challenges and opportunities of leveraging O-RAN to enable
real-time V2X control. Additionally, we enrich our discussion with
potential research directions stemming from the current state-of-the-art
and we provide preliminary simulation results that validate the
effectiveness of the proposed integration"

ABSTRACT="Positioning is one of the most promising feature of the latest fifth
generation (5G) standard for mobile communications. Positioning
functionalities can exploit both the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL)
communication direction. While most of the research efforts are devoted to
DL positioning, in this work we investigate the problem of UL positioning.
Differently from DL, UL communication is severely influenced by the
synchronization mechanism used by the Base Station (BS) to control the User
Equipment (UE), which primarily relies on timing advance procedure, and
whose errors impact directly on the ranging accuracy. By developing a
virtualized open-source 5G standalone network, we leverage the UL 5G
Sounding Reference Signals (SRSs), broadcasted for channel quality
assessments by the UE in a communication session, to perform ranging
between the UE and a BS. We analyze the ranging accuracy in terms of
measurement error distribution by placing a commercial mobile
phone device at different distances from the BS, assessing a range error of
9 m in 95\% of the observations."

Laying between the crowded lower frequency bands and the propagation-unfriendly higher bands (i.e., millimeter wave), the upper 6 GHz band (6425-7125 MHz) presents a valuable compromise between capacity and coverage. Recognizing its potential, the research community has expressed interest in this spectrum and conducted several studies. Despite this enthusiasm, the deployment of upper 6 GHz testbeds remains elusive. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting the results of a comprehensive measurement campaign conducted on a 5G NR cellular system operating in the upper 6 GHz band (6425-7125 MHz), specifically deployed within the Politecnico di Milano campus. Our objective was to evaluate the system's performance in a realistic environment and provide insights supported by empirical measurements. The measurement campaign yielded positive results, showcasing a remarkable channel capacity in urban areas, which remained consistently high even at the cell edge and in challenging non-line-of-sight and outdoor-to-indoor scenarios.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 17th ACM Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation \& Characterization}, pages = {49–55}, numpages = {7}, keywords = {5G New Radio, Upper 6 GHz, Field trial, Enhanced Mobile Broadband}, location = {Madrid, Spain}, series = {WiNTECH '23} }

ABSTRACT="The heterogeneity of use cases that next-generation
wireless systems need to support calls for flexible and programmable
networks that can autonomously adapt to the application requirements.
Specifically, traffic flows that support critical
applications (e.g., vehicular control or safety communications) often come
with a requirement in terms of guaranteed performance. At the same time,
others are more elastic and can adapt to the resources made available by
the network (e.g., video streaming). To this end, the Open Radio Access
Network (RAN) paradigm is seen as an enabler of dynamic control and
adaptation of the
protocol stack of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks in the
5th generation (5G) and beyond. Through its embodiment in the O-RAN
Alliance specifications, it introduces the RAN Intelligent Controllers
(RICs), which enable closed-loop control, leveraging a rich set of RAN Key
Performance Measurements (KPMs) to build a representation of the network
and enforcing dynamic control through the configuration of 3GPP-defined
stack parameters. In this paper, we leverage the Open RAN closed-loop
control capabilities to design, implement, and evaluate multiple
data-driven and dynamic Service Level Agreement (SLA) enforcement policies,
capable of adapting the RAN semi-persistent scheduling patterns to match
users'
requirements. To do so, we implement semi-persistent scheduling
capabilities in the OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G stack, as well as an easily
extensible and customizable version of the Open RAN E2 interface that
connects the OAI base stations to the near-real-time RIC. We deploy and
test our framework on Colosseum, a large-scale hardware-in-the-loop channel
emulator. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed Open RAN-based
solution in managing SLA in near-real-time."
